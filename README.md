# Welcome to the Task Manager program!

I have used Tkinter as GUI for this Python program.

## How it works
When running the program, you will first see a login window.
In our case, the login credentials are stored in a dictionary. <br> 
In case of a wrong input, an  error message will pop up.

Once successfully logged-in, you will access the task manager window.
You can then add and delete tasks. The 'View mine' option will only display the tasks attributed to the user who is logged in. If you want to view all the tasks again, just click on 'View all'. <br> 

## Here's what it looks like
