# Welcome to the Task Manager program!
## This Python program uses Tkinter

When running the program, you will first see a login window:

In our case, the login credentials are stored in a dictionary. <br> 
In case of a wrong input, the following error message will pop up:

Once succesfully logged-in, you will access the task manager window:

You can add and delete tasks. The 'View mine' option will only display the tasks attributed to the user who is logged in. If you want to view all the tasks again, just click on 'View all'. <br> 

## How to use
You can fork this repo and have a go at the different options displayed on the GUI!

<br>
Enjoy! 

<em> Note: the sole purpose of this program was to use a GUI for the first time, so the program itself is very simple.
